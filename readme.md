# Advent of Code 2023 with VIC-20

This is the second incarnation of the project of solving Advent of Code puzzles with a VIC-20!

## Motivation

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is something I've wanted to do. I wouldn't be able to get very high in the rankings, because of the time difference and because the best are significantly better than me, but it shouldn't stop me from doing things at my own pace.

It may take 25 days. It may take 25 years. But gosh darn it, I'm gonna try.

Reliving my youth is something I've also wanted to do. When I was young, I owned a VIC-20 and I learned to program with it. Those days my programs weren't all that good, and I haven't dared to look at them since. Nowadays I have developed and matured, and I sometimes wonder if I could achieve better programs now. Advent of Code would be a nice place to start.

A puzzle may take 25 seconds. A puzzle may take 25 hours. But gosh darn it, I'm gonna try.

## Equipment

My old Vic-20 from the 80s still exists, but I suspect it won't work. That's why I'm going to use an emulator, namely Vice. It's available at <https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/>.

Even though I use an emulator, I try to use the host machine as little as possible. All coding is done in the emulator and only input files are imported to disk images in the PC.

I'm going to start with just a basic Vic, with no memory expansion. Based on the experiences of the first try I am willing to "purchase" memory expansions when the need arises.

I'm going to use a disk drive, because of the sheer size of input from Advent of Code. I'm going to move files between PC and Vic-20 with DirMaster, which is available at <https://style64.org/dirmaster>.

## Literature

Books for reference can be found from <http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/>.

## Repo organization

The repo is organized by year and day. The programs are saved to this repo as printouts.

There may be a problem if a printout is pasted to the emulator or imported to a disk image. Even though I have tried not to use any special petscii characters, the upper and lower case letters may be mixed up. It shouldn't be too hard to write a script to import the file into an emulator or a disk image somehow.

Mind you, I've spent countless days typing in listings from magazines, one character at a time. Hunting those typos down was a major pain in the backside.

This is the second repository. I deleted the first one because it had the puzzle inputs, and sharing them is frowned upon in the community.
